## About the project
This application is a fully standalone solution for handling the needs of Coders Camp organizers, participants, and mentors.
The goal of this project was to build the backend service with all the necessary mechanisms to store the Coders Camp-related information and provide the corresponding frontend application allowing to manage the Coders Camp course.

The project was developed during [CodersCamp Course](https://coderscamp.edu.pl/) in Feb-Apr 2020.

## Team behind the project
- Krystian Kijak (Mentor)
- Ireneusz (Development Manager for BE, Code Review for FE)
- Robert (Product Owner, Code Review for FE)
- Justyna (Code Review for FE, Development Manager for BE)
- Konrad (Code Review for FE, Product Owner for BE)
- Filip (Code Review all the time)

## Project structure
The project repository is split into two parts:
- **Api** folder containing all the backend functionalities
- **Frontend** folder containing the client-side part of the application

## Application functionalities
- For Coders Camp organizers
    - managing the course participants
    - grouping the users with mentors
    - having an overview of users progress
    - sharing the learning materials with the participants
- For Coders Camp mentors
    - having an overview of group progress
    - private sharing the grades with group members
    - grading the projects (for own group and the group where the mentor is a reviewer)
- For Coders Camp participants      
    - checking the course timeline
    - overview of the grades
    - access to the learning materials
    - submitting a project

### How to run the frontend app
1. Just go to [live application page](https://quirky-minsky-7671f3.netlify.app/)
2. Clone the repository, go to the 'frontend' folder, and run ```npm start``` command

### Frontend app functionalities
Frontend application is meeting the core functionalities defined in the ```REQUIREMENTS.md``` file. Admin panel for organization management is fully functional, core functionalities for user and mentor are available as well.
Below there are selected features described:
- **User grades presentation** - The user gets his grades displayed with color-markings to ease the understanding of the progress. There is also a progress bar with the current total average is displayed
- **Mentor gradesheets management** - Excel no more! Our app allows mentors to provide their feedback easily and quickly.
- **Password reset** - Bad memory? No problem - password reset can be performed only with the email (and after login as well, from the My Profile tab)
- **Error messaging** - If something goes wrong the user is not left alone! Informative error messages will tell him what is happening.
- **Search** - Each tab is fully searchable, allowing you to find the items you're looking for.
- **App displaying the content of the active course by default** - Application is displaying the information about the sections, projects, teams, etc. for the course selected in the Course Tab in the admin view (to initially filter out the content)


### Used technologies
- **React** - Javascript library for building user interfaces
- **Typescript** - superset of JS for additional static typing

- **Storybook** - UI component explorer

### Frontend folder content
- **src** folder - source code for the frontend application
    - **api** - functionalities for connecting with the backend service
    - **app** - basic application utility components
    - **components** - component folders, each containing a source file, redux-toolkit slice, storybook setup and test file
    - **Repositories*** - functions for database interactions
    - **Routes** - endpoint routes definitions
    - **Services** - functions for executing database interactions
- **models** - data models for information pulled from the backend
- **stories** - storybook setup
- **theme** - MaterialUI setup
- App.tsx - application initialization for routing
- index.tsx - main application initialization

# Backend service description
### How to run the backend
1. You can clone the repository, install the dependencies with ```npm install``` and run the app with ```npm run start:dev```
You need to remember there are several environmental variables that are not stored in the repository for safety - please reach out to the development team to get them for testing.
Alternatively, you can provide a link to MongoDB Atlas database and provide a FastMail email credentials in ```.env``` file.
2. You can also just use the production version of the application available at ```https://coders-camp-organization-app.herokuapp.com/```

For both options be aware that you have to 
1. Create your own account using ```/api/register``` endpoint
2. Log in using ```/api/login``` endpoint
3. Then you will be able to access the user endpoints - the endpoints available for Admins/Mentors can be tested after requesting the appropriate access from the app development team

### Endpoint documentation
All endpoints with sample requests are described in ```swagger.yml``` file - you can check the documentation by copying the content to e.g. ```https://editor.swagger.io/```

### Backend functionalities
Application is meeting the functional requirements defined at the beginning of the project and stored in separate file ```REQUIREMENTS.md```. Below some of the interesting features are described.

- **User management/Authorization** - Each user has an appropriate role assigned (Admin, Mentor, User) and can only use the endpoints that are approved for his level of permissions
Users are being authorized using the token sent in each request header that has to match the token from the response sent after login.
- **Password management** - Password is being hashed during the registration and is safely stored in the database in hashed form.
- **Password reset** - When password reset is requested then email with password reset link is sent with authentication token added as URL parameter. Token is valid for 1 hour. Only email owner can open the link and change his password, with additional token validation to ensure full process safety.
